# The evolution of the BSD license

Today the variation between BSD licenses all revolves around which clauses they retain.
However, in the early days of BSD distributions, the variations was substantially different.
This blog post will use the https://www.tuhs.org[TUHS Archive] and Kirk McKusick's BSD archive DVD to trace the early history of the BSD license.
While one might categorize these early BSD variants in different ways using the more monikers like ISC-like or MIT-like, this blog will avoid that analysis.
Instead, it will focus on how things were marked, the variations that exist, and a few other items of interest.

# The Early Days 1BSD to 4.1BSD

## 1BSD

The first Berkeley Software Distribution (1BSD) was more a collection of programs for Unix rather than a new Unix distribution (as we think of the word today).
It was a mini USENIX tape, in some ways.
The USENIX tapes were a collection of random software that people contributed before different early USENIX conferences.

1BSD had a Pascal compiler, the ex editor, a modified yacc for the Pascal compiler, a star trek game (rewritten from earlier BASIC and FORTRAN versions in C) and some experimentals shells (ashell).
It was released in late 1977, so post-dates 6th Edition Unix but pre-dates the 7th edition.
There are no copyright markings at all on this tape.
There are no license to copy granted in files or in  `READ_ME` files.
As The label on the tape said only:
 The contents of this tape are
 distributed to UNIX licensees
 only, subject to the software
 agreement you have with Western
 Electric and an agreement with
 the University of California.
so it was targeted specifically at AT&T Unix licensees, but contained no AT&T code.
