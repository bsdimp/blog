# The evolution of the BSD license

Today the variation between BSD licenses all revolves around which clauses they retain.
However, in the early days of BSD distributions, the variations was substantially different.
This blog post will use the https://www.tuhs.org[TUHS Archive] and Kirk McKusick's BSD archive DVD to trace the early history of the BSD license.
While one might categorize these early BSD variants in different ways using the more monikers like ISC-like or MIT-like, this blog will avoid that analysis.
Instead, it will focus on how things were marked, the variations that exist, and a few other items of interest.

# The Early Days 1BSD to 4.1BSD

## 1BSD

The first Berkeley Software Distribution (1BSD) was more a collection of programs for Unix rather than a new Unix distribution (as we think of the word today).
It was a mini USENIX tape, in some ways.
The USENIX tapes were a collection of random software that people contributed before different early USENIX conferences.

1BSD had a Pascal compiler, the ex editor, a modified yacc for the Pascal compiler, a star trek game (rewritten from earlier BASIC and FORTRAN versions in C) and some experimentals shells (ashell).
It was released in late 1977, so post-dates 6th Edition Unix but pre-dates the 7th edition.
There are no copyright markings at all on this tape (a case insensitive grep of the TUHS 1BSD archive extracted from https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/UCB/1bsd.tar.gz for the word 'copyright' returns no results).
There are no license to copy granted in files or in  `READ_ME` files.
Note that the tar file has a number of directories with ar(1) .a files.
However, this is the old 'binary' ar format from the 6th edition and it needs special tools to extract.
Even though the format is 'binary', text files are stored without compression so grep will find strings that existed in the source or binary files.

The only clue as to licnese is on the physical lable on the table, which said:

 The contents of this tape are
 distributed to UNIX licensees
 only, subject to the software
 agreement you have with Western
 Electric and an agreement with
 the University of California.

so it was targeted specifically at AT&T Unix licensees, but contained no AT&T code.
The 1BSD license agreeemnt with the University of California appears is hard to find.
About 65 tapes were produced and shipped.
They weren't all identical, but had updates applied and were sent out in batches whenever there were enough to do.

1BSD appears in the TUHS archive based on a donation from Marshall Kirk McKusick of an archival copy of a 1BSD distribution tape from January 19, 1978.
It also appears in Dr. McKusick's BSD DVD archive.
Permission is granted to copy the files in the BSD archive (with some exceptions).
Dr  McKusick has indicated to me in private conversation that he is distributing 1bsd with permission of the University and imposes no further restriction on its copying (which is why it can appear in the TUHS archive).

It was a simpler time.

## 2BSD

The second Berkeely Software Distribution (2BSD) was released in mid 1978 according to Peter Salus' Quarter Century of Unix [QCU].
